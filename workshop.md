# Workshop: Data visualization using R #

Organizers: Andrew Tredennick, Karthik Ram, Naupaka Zimmerman  
Speakers: Naupaka Zimmerman, ...  

R is one of the most [widely used](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/) tools for statistical analysis in the academic community. In addition to the large suite of analytical tools, R is also capable of producing publication quality figures that can easily be embedded into publications, presentations, and lab notebooks. In this workshop we will demonstrate some of these tools, notably the functionality in the [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) library (and [associated](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) [packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmcmc/index.html
)). We will also demonstrate how to export graphics in various formats for journal submission. We will provide some example datasets beforehand but feel free to bring your own along with your laptop and a pre-installed copy of R or RStudio to participate.
